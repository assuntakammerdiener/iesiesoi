Help me with comodo killswitch please. I should put all processes in the vpn rule, right? VPN rule vs allowed application? Hi. This example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy\_NyBvFbO8 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy_NyBvFbO8) After i create a killswitch, i try to get all of the traffic out of the vpn. That is also svchost.exe right? Things work ok, but qBittorrent crashes allot. I want to put all traffic in that rule including svchost.exe, qBittorrent and everything. There So my question has two parts, firstly i would like to ask for your opinion on what is the best way to keep your computer security at a level that you would most likely never get an infection unless you are individually targeted. To avoid that kind of infection currently i am using the windows antivirus + UAC (and standar user account) + malwarebytes free (on demand) + hitmanpro (on demand) + adblocker + updating everything that touches the internet + tinywall with whitelisting + common sense. Hi. Today I just happened to open up Comodo Killswitch just for a regular check, and noticed something peculiar. Half of my connections were all being routed through a single domain called bshades.eu. ( Things got worse when I started seeing Google headlines such as "FBI raid on blackshades servers" and "bshades.eu - scammer site". So at this point I realize that I have been /r/pwned pretty hard. My question is, what do I do now? I'm already running a full AVAST. My League of Legends is stuck on "logging in". I did everything. I normally enter the client, enter my password, press enter. Authentication is successful, then the "logging on" screen shows up. There even is a sound of logging on. But it stays like this for several seconds or so, then its shows an error message "Connection Failure: Unable to connect to the PVP.net server" My account works on friends PCs. On my PC i can't log into any account on any server. It's not about PC, I installed Recently my computer started having these problems: Could not access Microsoft or antivirus websites. Connecting a flash drive would mean that shortcuts, exe and Recycler files would be copied. It would reappear seconds after deletion. What I did: Downloaded anti-malware bytes and scanned and deleted all viruses found--Trojans, Virus Ramnits. Downloaded Comodo internet Security 2013---Its still on the PC. Though it cannot connect to the internet. Finally after getting frustra. 
1- What exactly is Comodo Killswitch? Is it safe, and do any of you guys use it? 2- I heard that 'worms' (the type of malware not earthworms) can actually infect your internet connection and then be transferred over to other devices/computers and infect those too? Is this true? Can your internet connection itself actually be infected? And if so, how do you run a virus scan on your own internet connection to remove them? :O Or is there another way to remove worms from your connection besides. killswitch comodo Firewall All VPN's tutorial link (https://www.bestvpn.com/blog/10218/build-your-own-vpn-kill-switch-in-windows-comodo/). Hey guys, been looking into getting a seedbox instead of just a VPN and am thinking I'll go with Seedbox.io for cheapness. I'm wanting to do a couple of things though and unsure as I've never used OpenVPN. I want to use the box as a constant VPN service that I can toggle on/off if need be with a killswitch so I don't leak. I read you can do this with a firewall (I use comodo) any of you have a guide please? Also I'd like to be able to transfer files to friends at times, what would Hi all. A question I see asked a lot online is how to get just one application to route over a VPN whilst all other traffic goes over the normal Internet connection and I have been reading about split tunneling etc. One of the recommendations is to run a vm with the vpn running inside leaving the main OS to use the Internet directly. Having tested this setup, I've notice my vpn speeds hitting no more than 30/40 Meg over a 200 Meg connection but when running So, I couldn't think of any title that's actually catchy, and I apologize. Supernatural has me somewhat distracted. (Currently re-watching it, on Season 1 Ep. 6) You don't have to be from Kentucky if you want to talk. :3 I can talk about mostly anything, if the other party can maintain the topic, and keep up with me when I change topics. I watch things on Netflix a lot. Some of my favorite shows are Supernatural, Firefly, and Prison Break. I enjoy listening to music; Particularly bands So, I couldn't think of any title that's actually catchy, and I apologize. Supernatural has me somewhat distracted. (Currently re-watching it, on Season 1 Ep. 6) You don't have to be from Kentucky if you want to talk. :3 The only requirement is that you're able to hold an intelligent conversation.
